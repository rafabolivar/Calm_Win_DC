Windows 2016 Domain Controller Blueprint for Nutanix CALM

Passphrase for importing credentials is: nutanix/4u

The blueprint is using an image located on Nutanix RTP Fileserver (http://10.55.251.38/workshop_staging/Windows2016.qcow2), so this should be modified in each case to match local repository.

The blueprint creates an AD Domain called "midominio.local" and 5 users (Rafa, Lluis, Seb, Alberto, Sergi) with password: nutanix/4u.
